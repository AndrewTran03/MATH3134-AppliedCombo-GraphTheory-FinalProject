-In Graph Theory, one of the most common solved problems is detecting cycles in graphs. In my Applied Combinatorics (with Graph Theory) course, we covered how to visually detect graph cycles. However, I wanted to elevate the sophistication of this algorithm from just solving it on-paper to using programming. Therefore, using concepts such as recursion and Depth-First Search (DFS), I was able to make an interactive program where the user could enter the vertex (and inadvertiently the edge) data to build the graphical representation and detect cycles. This cycle detection algorithm is completed in the Java Programming language. Regardless, the succinct and detailed commenting should make this mini-project understandable to coders and non-coders, alike. Whenever I have time, I will try to implement a GUI for user visualization purposes.
